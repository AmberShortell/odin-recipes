    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F. Start the recipe when the oven is ready. Read the entire recipe card. Wash and dry all produce. Cut broccoli into 1-inch pieces. Cut potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Mince garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Prepare two parchment-lined baking sheets. To one sheet, add potatoes and 1 tbsp oil (double for 4 portions). Season with salt and toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Bake on the lower rack of oven for 22-26 min, until crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.</li>
            <li>While potatoes roast, to the second sheet, add broccoli and 1 tbsp oil (double for 4 portions). Season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast on the upper rack of oven, for 10-12 min until tender, tossing halfway through cooking.</li>
            <li>While broccoli and potatoes roast, pat pork dry with paper towel, then season with salt and pepper. Add &#189; tsp mayonnaise to each piece of pork and rub to coat. In a medium bowl, add Breading Blend, then pork chops, one at a time, turning to coat all sides. Discard any excess Breading Blend. In a large non-stick pan, heat 1 tbsp oil (double for 4 portions) over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add pork. Sear, for 4-5 min on one side, until golden. Add another 1 tbsp oil (double for 4 portions) then flip pork and sear, for 2-3 min, on the other side, until golden and cooked through.</li>
            <li>While pork cooks, in a small bowl, whisk together mustard, remaining mayonnaise, garlic (use 1-3 cloves) and 1 tbsp water (double for 4 portions). Season with salt and pepper. Serve pork with roasted potatoes and broccoli alongside. Drizzle garlic remoulade over top. Enjoy!</li>
